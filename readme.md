## Disclaimer
This Bot is still work in progress therefore messy as hell. It's also my **first project** in JavaScript **EVER**. 
So please don't be angry if I am not doing something the easiest way. Or using different methods to do the same thing.
I will try to improve my skills as I work on the bot.
